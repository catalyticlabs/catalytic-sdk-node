_Note: This may ultimately be renamed to `catalytic-sdk-js` if it is browser-compatible, but I don't want to be boxed into that since Node is the priority._


## AutoRest Configuration

The default configuration expects the input to be on `stdin`.

```yaml
---
typescript:
- output-folder: ./src/internal
```
