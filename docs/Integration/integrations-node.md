You can use Integrations to connect to other systems to your Catalytic Workflows. Catalytic has a number of built-in Integrations for common systems. Each [Integration](doc:the-integration-entity-node) can have multiple [Connections](doc:the-integrationconnection-entity-node). For example, if you integrate with Google, you can have different Connections for different users or groups. A Workflow can then use different connections based on what it automates.
